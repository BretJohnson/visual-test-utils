This package extends VisualTestUtils, providing an AppConnector
that can be used so that the client app being tested can communicate
with a test runner or other process on the desktop. It's a bidirectional pipe,
based on [Tempest](https://github.com/drasticactions/Drastic.Tempest).

Support includes creating a visual representation of the image diffs.
