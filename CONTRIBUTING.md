## Best practices

* Use Windows PowerShell or [PowerShell Core][pwsh] (including on Linux/OSX) to run .ps1 scripts.
  Some scripts set environment variables to help you, but they are only retained if you use PowerShell as your shell.

## Prerequisites

All dependencies can be installed by running the `init.ps1` script at the root of the repository
using Windows PowerShell or [PowerShell Core][pwsh] (on any OS).
Some dependencies installed by `init.ps1` may only be discoverable from the same command line environment the init script was run from due to environment variables, so be sure to launch Visual Studio or build the repo from that same environment.
Alternatively, run `init.ps1 -InstallLocality Machine` (which may require elevation) in order to install dependencies at machine-wide locations so Visual Studio and builds work everywhere.

The only prerequisite for building, testing, and deploying from this repository
is the [.NET SDK](https://get.dot.net/).
You should install the version specified in `global.json` or a later version within
the same major.minor.Bxx "hundreds" band.
For example if 2.2.300 is specified, you may install 2.2.300, 2.2.301, or 2.2.310
while the 2.2.400 version would not be considered compatible by .NET SDK.
See [.NET Core Versioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/) for more information.

## Package restore

The easiest way to restore packages may be to run `init.ps1` which automatically authenticates
to the feeds that packages for this repo come from, if any.
`dotnet restore` or `nuget restore` also work but may require extra steps to authenticate to any applicable feeds.

## Building

This repository can be built on Windows, Linux, and OSX.

Building, testing, and packing this repository can be done by using the standard dotnet CLI commands (e.g. `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`, `dotnet pack`, etc.).

## Repo template

This repo is based on Andrew Arnott's library template, used by several other VS repos. See https://aka.ms/lib.template and https://github.com/aarnott/Library.Template/tree/microbuild.
Periodically we should follow the steps there to get the latest updates in the template. In brief those steps are:

```ps1
git checkout main           # your default branch
git pull                    # make sure you're at tip
git fetch libtemplate       # fetch latest Library.Template
git merge libtemplate/main  # then resolve any merge conflicts
```
